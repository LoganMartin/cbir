# Content Based Image Retrieval Project

This project allows a user to query a database of images using their own uploaded image. A selection of similar images to the one uploaded are displayed back to the user based on the CBIR algorithm chosen.

The user has the option of searching based on the following image features:

* Color Moment
* Local Binary Pattern
* A hybrid of the two
